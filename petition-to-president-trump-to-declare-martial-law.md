# Petition to President Trump to Declare Martial Law

__Petition of United States of America Elector(s) and others,__
__to President Donald Trump to Declare Martial Law,__
__and to Arrest and Charge Traitors, and to Command the Military__
__to Conduct a Re-Election in Certain States__

__To the Honourable The President of the United States of America:__

__I am an elector__ entitled to vote in an election in the United States of America,
for a member of congress, for a member of the senate, and for the President,
__and/or I support this petition__ to President Donald Trump.

__It is my duty__ to inform you of my will with regards to the 3rd November 2020 United States of America election (“the election”).

Pursuant to the proven and alleged widespread fraud in the election, occasioned with, and/or by, and/or in relation to:

 - The Dominion voting machines and other voting machines.
 - State election officials.
 - State Attorney Generals.
 - State Secretaries of State.
 - Fraudulent votes of many types including votes by dead people, validated or “cured” blank votes, votes illegally swapped between candidates, phantom voter votes, destruction of legitimate votes, mass identical votes dropped around 4AM on 4th November 2020, inter-state delivery of hundreds of thousands of pre-filled “votes”, “lost” legitimate votes, votes counted multiple times instead of once.
 - Many procedural and process failures including disallowing of duly authorized poll watchers from watching vote counting, poll watchers being not allowed back into counting areas after they returned from a toilet break.
 - Illegal changes to election processes and election conduct.
 - Destruction of legitimate votes.
 - Destruction of vote counting audit trails.
 - Obstruction by election officials and by members of state parliaments against those seeking to make discovery of vote fraud.
 - Dominion voting machine seals being removed, tampered with and/or non existent.
 - Illegal and fraudulent use and handling of USB and memory sticks.
 - Destruction of USB and memory stick usage, check in and check out logs.
 - Suitcases full of votes being pulled out from under desks after poll watchers had been ordered to leave and go home for the night and subsequently vote counting of the “votes” within those suitcases being counted during the night without any poll watchers present.
 - Illegal influence and interference of voters when voting.
 - 68% and 70% rejection rates of votes, pre-programmed into the Dominion vote counting machines.
 - Over 1,000 affidavits of witnesses to election fraud, irregularities and other election problems.
 - During a “risk-limited audit” ordered by Michigan Secretary of State Benson (as a result of the Dominion vote counting machine discoveries made by Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno) a Michigan Secretary of State official was recorded on video telling multiple volunteers in the audit to count “multiple ballots with the very same signature” during that audit.
 - Extreme bias and censorship by “Big Tech” including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google leading up to the election.
 - Extreme bias and suppression of relevant information such as Hunter Biden’s laptop, by the “Main Stream Media” including CNN, the New York Times, MSNBC and even Fox News.
 - Foreign interference in the election by China, Iran and possibly other foreign powers.
 - Blatant bias in rulings by state courts.
 - Apparent problems in the Supreme Court of the United States where the Texas case against certain swing states, which was clearly a case within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States, was rejected by that court for want of a “judicially cognizable interest in the matter”, which from the lay person’s perspective is absurd (how can a state such as Texas which DOES abide by the constitution, NOT be affected by an illegal election outcome due to other states NOT abiding by the constitution??).
 - As alleged by Attorney Lin Wood, corruption and independence and conflict of interest problems with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, Chief Justice John Roberts, and similarly alleged problems with Justice Stephen Breyer.
 - The “six dimensions of voting irregularities” in the report by Trade Advisor Peter Navarro, “include: outright voter fraud, ballot mishandling, contestable process fouls, equal protection clause violations, voting machine irregularities, and significant statistical anomalies.” “All six of those voting issues were present in at least two key states, according to the report, and a total of six battleground states experienced multiple examples of the other dimensions.” “Navarro’s report cites numerous affidavits that allege the exploitation of the elderly and the infirm by “effectively hijacking their identities and votes” while accusing Democrats of politicizing the COVID-19 pandemic so they could challenge state election laws to, among other things, relax voter ID requirements to the point that ballot harvesting and fraud occur without notice,” and ultimately a “statistically impossible” win for Joe Biden.
 - Many violations of state laws in the conduct of the elections and in the handling of ballots, memory sticks and vote counting machines.

__And further__ pursuant to the evident corruption of certain politicians with apparent conflicts of interest with China and other foreign powers;

it is clear to me that an appropriate way forward in order to bring forth justice and to bypass certain of the corruption and sabotage evidently happening in the United States of America in the courts and legislative bodies, that you, Honourable President Trump, __declare Martial Law__ with the purpose and intention of arresting and charging those responsible for the aforesaid illegal acts, corruptions and treason;

AND for the purpose of __conducting a free and fair election__ in certain states under the supervision of our military.

__I support this course of action__ which has also been called for by General Michael Flynn, by Virginia state Senator and gubernatorial candidate Amanda Chase, by Attorney Lin Wood, and by many others.

_Yours faithfully,_
